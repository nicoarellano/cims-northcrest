Let's check out two of them to understand what they do. First, the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) definiton:\n\n> *An API is a connection between computers or between computer programs. It is a type of software interface, offering a service to other pieces of software. A document or standard that describes how to build or use such a connection or interface is called an API specification. A computer system that meets this standard is said to implement or expose an API. The term API may refer either to the specification or to the implementation.*\n\nSimple but confusing, right? Fortunately [this reddit user has a simpler and more understandable definition](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/lagk1/eli5_what_is_an_api/c2r8hie/):\n\n> *Imagine you have a little toy car. You can move that toy car forward and backwards with your hands, and make it go slow or fast, and do all sorts of other things that car toys can do. But then you decide you want your friend, Jimmy, to be able to control the car as well. But you don't want to give the car to him outright -- it's your car! You just want to let him control it without needing to move it for him. So you build a remote control for the car and give it to Jimmy. That remote control has a specific set of functions that tell the car what to do: go forward, backwards, and so on. Since it's your car, you programmed the remote and gave it limitations so Jimmy could only do certain things with it. Jimmy takes the remote and controls the car and has fun, but can't do anything with it beyond what the remote control will let him. An API is the remote control. The car is an application.*\n\nEssentialy, an API is an interface that let's you use a complex software in an easier and controlled way. Here we will using what is called a [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) API; you don't need to get deep into it to use it, just know that they exists and have the link in case you want to dive into it. What you need to have in mind is:\n\n- The client (you) make **requests** to the server through the API\n- The server returns a **response** to the cliente through the API\n\nAnd in those requests there are different actions that the API can perform:\n\n- **GET** retrieves data from an API.\n- **POST** sends new data to an API.\n- **PATCH** and **PUT** update existing data.\n- **DELETE** removes existing data.\n\nAll these actions are performed to an specific **endpoint**: these are defined urls to performed pre-defined actions. For example, you get your building's data from and endpoint and you get your users data from another one.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# How to get access?","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now that we know how an API works let's focus on the Onboard API. First thing you need is to get access, you can not simply start making requests ;)\n\nYou will need an API key, let's review some definitions before starting.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## API Keys","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As a general definition, API keys are personal tokens commonly used to control the utilization of the API’s interface and track how it is being used. This is often as a precaution to prevent abuse or malicious use. \n\nIn the particular case of Onboard API, API keys allow secure, automated access to the Onboard portal. They are granted explicit access to API endpoints and data by attaching one or more scopes to the key. The key is linked to its creator's user account, and can only access information that is already visible in the UI. This means that an API key which has been granted all scopes is equivalent to a logged in user.\n\nSo to start using Onboard API, **make sure you not only have an account, but you also have generated an API key**.

Looks weird for a datetime, right? This is becauses is in [Unix Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time), those are the miliseconds that passed since Unix Epoch; The Unix epoch is 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970 (an arbitrary date).
